## Description
In 2020 I set the goal for myself to watch one movie I haven't seen before. I was keeping track of them in a spreadsheet. As the spreadsheet was getting quite long I figure it would be a good idea to turn it into a web app. 

I was also learning about progressive web applications at the time so I figure it would be a way for be to try that.

This is the personal project I'm the most proud of because me and some friends use it on a consistent basis and it's my first Full Stack project outside of School.
